*Text messaging tool similar to WhatsApp web using your smartphone as a server.*

> This app has a timebomb hardcoded in the code, the current APK wa set to work up to a date in june this year. I will update the code and the apk to remove the timebomb soon. If you are a developer and in a hurry, just clone the repo and remove the function timebomb() and anywhere it might have been called and you'll be good to go.
